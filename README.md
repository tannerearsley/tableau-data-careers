- Interactive Dashboards | Data & AI Career Insights
- Created 6/21/2025

---

## Project Overview
- Developed multiple charts and dashboards from raw job listing data  
- Designed interactive dashboards to provide career insights
- Focused and filtered on experience levels for the first dashboard, and general insights for the second

---

## Dashboard Structure
- Sheets are grouped in sets of four, followed by the dashboard they belong to  
- Dashboards are meant to be viewed **sequentially**, with interactivity through filters and hover effects  
- Each sheet and dashboard highlights different aspects of the job market based on experience, title, or other fields

---

## Included Files
- `data_career_dashboard.twbx` → Contains all sheets and dashboards in a Tableau Packaged Workbook
- `ai_job_dataset.csv` → Original, uncleaned data set sourced from Kaggle for analysis
- `experience_level_dashboard.png` → Screenshot of first dashboard, segregating metrics by experience level
- `career_info_dashboard.png` → Screenshot of second dashboard, containing general information about data/ai job metrics

## Notes
- The original dataset source link is from Kaggle, and is included in this repository. 
- This project was made and updated while beginning and conducting my data job search, so it is a passion project that I hope to expand on further in the future
- Completed using Tableau entirely.
